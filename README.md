[here](https://github.com/PedroCristo/portfolio_project_4/issues)

### The Scope

#### Main Site Goals

* To provide users with a visually pleasing website that is intuitive to use and easy to navigate.
* To provide a website with a clear purpose.

## Design

#### Colours

![Colours Palete](./assets/readme/extras/tasty_blog_colors_palete.png)<br>

* The colour scheme is kept simple by opting for a combination of white text set against the image
background and black text against the white background. For the navbar was set as a white background
colour that changes when the user scrolls. For a linear gradient, 3 colours were used dark
blue, orange and purple. This gradient is also used as a search box background. To highlight
the icons an interactive colour set of light blue was used.

#### Typography

* The Lato font is used as the main font for the whole project and the Kaushan font is used to
display the word enjoy in the Post Details and About pages.

#### Imagery

* All the imagery is related to the recipes and website design. Only 7 images are static.
The remaining imagery will be uploaded by the author to the database.
